    "The problems in this homework do not require complex commands, but require you to exercise algorithmic thinking. It is recommended that you follow the four step method (Describe, Decompose, Translate, and Combine) when solving the problems, and to build up the solution incrementally instead of writing a function to start off. For examples of how to do this, refer to the Handout Solutions (posted on Blackboard) for session 6. \n",

    "## Q2. Estimating Revenue under Dynamic Pricing\n",
    "\n",
    "In applications such as airline ticketing, capacity is limited and one pricing strategy is to increase the price when only a few number of tickets are left. In this exercise, the price is initially `price1` and increases to `price2` when a threshold number of items are left. You goal is to estimate the total revenue given a forecast of willingness to pay by customers. \n",

    "Write a function called `revenue` with five input arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `values`: a list of maximum willingness to pay, similar to Case 7a in session 5.\n",
    "- `price1`: the initial price of the product.\n",
    "- `price2`: the updated price when only a few items are left.\n",
    "- `capacity`: the total number of products that can be sold.\n",
    "- `threshold`: when only this many products are left, the price increases from `price1` to `price2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function should return the total revenue from the given pricing policy. You should assume that customers in the list `values` come sequentially. For example, given the input `values=[10,20,25,30,40]`, `price1=20`, `price2=30`, `capacity=2`, `threshold=1`, the function should return 50. This is because the first customer does not buy, the second customer buys, at which point price increases to 30 since only one item is left. The third customer does not buy. The final customer buys at the increased price of 30. The last customer does not buy since no more items are left."
